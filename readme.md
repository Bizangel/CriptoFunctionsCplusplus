Direct implementations of some popular cryptography algorithms in c++.
This was done as a school project, and also a fun way to learn about cryptography. 

Refer to `CriptoWorks/CriptoFunctions.h` for said implementations.

Some of these include:

- Square and Multiply and Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- Rabin Miller Prime test
- Square and Multiply
- Classic Cryptography (Shift-Cipher, Affine Cipher)

With said algorithms, some encryptions and decryptions samples can be found in `CriptoWorks/main.cpp` encrypting using RSA algorithm and ElGamal algorithm.
